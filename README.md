    Our project consists of receiving user submissions through a database with important details about fire incidents, which users can utilize from anywhere in the world to report a fire.

    We consult publicly available NASA data that monitors the entire world in real-time and reflect this data, updating it every minute. Data older than 48 hours is automatically removed from the system.

    We provide an interface where the user can:

    Report a fire incident
    View a global map to understand where fire outbreaks are occurring

    In the future, we can implement notifications for institutions involved in firefighting and property owners in specific regions, whether they are private or municipal.
